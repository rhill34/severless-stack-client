/* Now that we are able to create a new note, let’s create a page where we can see a list of all the notes a user has created. It makes sense that this would be the homepage (even though we use the / route for the landing page). So we just need to conditionally render the landing page or the homepage depending on the user session.

Currently, our Home container is very simple. Let’s add the conditional rendering in there.
